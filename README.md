# Python Projects

Hello there, if you're reading this you either know what you're doing or have no idea what to do.

Before I tell both parties what to do, these programs are just projects I've done on the side for school or when I get bored of my ever expanding game library. 

Now, for those who know what you're doing. These programs were made in Windows 10 (although if you know what you're doing you could probably easily refactor some code), and these programs run on Python 3.9.

And for those who have no idea what you're doing. Hi, welcome to Python, this is a programming language. In order to run any of these programs (aside from the markdown file and some other ones), you need [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/). I'm not going to give a tutorial on what to do but make sure you click "Add Python 3 to PATH" on the installer".
