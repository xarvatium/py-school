# Python Projects

Hello there, if you're reading this you either know what you're doing or have no idea what to do.

Before I tell both parties what to do, these programs are just projects I've done on the side for school or when I get bored of my Steam library.  

First off, for those who know what you're doing. These programs were made in Windows 10 (although if you know what you're doing you could probably easily refactor some code), and these programs run on Python 3.8.
